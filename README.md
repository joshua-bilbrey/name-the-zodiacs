# name-the-zodiacs

An educational tool to help you memorize the zodiac constellations.

This tool allows you to click on the zodiac constellations and then try to enter their correct name. It is all done with turtle and pandas. 

If you do not get all 12 zodiacs correct before exiting the application it will create a .csv file with the zodiacs you missed.

Thanks for trying this tool and let me know if you would like to see any improvements!
